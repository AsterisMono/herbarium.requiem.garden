Noa Virellia, INFP-T. *Tending flowers in the wires.*

Super homebody, former permanent resident of VRChat, gentle yet firm Maine Coon.

I care about whether systems are elegant, whether boundaries are clear, and whether people's positions in the system are treated gently.

## Pronouns

she/they 🏳️‍⚧️.

Still believe that one day magic will arrive and turn me into a cute girl, but upon turning around I realize I've passed the age for HRT.

~~So *currently* a trans-friendly straight(?) male.~~ *Take her hand, and set her free. —— 2025.06.01*

## What I Do

TypeScript full-stack. Before the tide of AGI truly sweeps over, temporarily choosing to coexist with the waves.

Junior DevOps, GitOps practitioner. Believe that "a system capable of being fully reconstructed is worthy of long-term reliance."
