## Ⅰ. "Falling"

> This is the story of a girl with flaxen hair.

The air swept past my ears.

The airflow joyfully leapt and danced through my strands of hair, feeling gentle, like a soft, large hand.

All around was silent, with no sound to be heard. The wind that should have been present dissipated, rendering the area as quiet as the far north. A sense of loneliness fluttered down like snowflakes, enveloping me in the unknown center of the universe.

"Where is this place?" I asked inwardly, fearing to break the unspeakable silence. There was no answer, but I could feel white feathers dancing in the air, drifting and weaving a fluffy web.

"Is anyone there?" I softly uttered the words, fearing to disturb the white feathers dancing gently. No response. White light flickered on my eyelids, repeatedly reminding me that light was very close.

The airflow came from below, gently lifting my back. They crossed and swirled past my sides, creating a faint suffocating feeling above.

It kept urging me, "Open your eyes, open your eyes and take a look!"

I obeyed the call, took a difficult deep breath and silently counted one, two, three, then—slowly opened my left eye.

A white dome came into view. Noon-like scorching light poured down, and my vision began to burn.

Pain arrived late, and I had no choice but to close my eyes, struggling to decipher the blurred afterimages left on my retinas. A pure white sky, pale blue horizon, a blinding light from nowhere. No information, baffling.

"Where am I exactly?" I tried inputting this question, only to receive a warning window marked "NO DATA."

A peculiar touch came from my palm, and I lightly clenched my fist, feeling a piece of white feather. The child had just left the dance under some pretext and was unexpectedly caught by me. The white feather lightly trembled in the airflow, and I comforted it, while secretly laughing.

The airflows continued running as usual—even if you stretched out an arm, becoming an irregular object, they would flow and reorganize instantly, enveloping you again like a thick cling film, wrapping around a restless little animal.

I stretched out an arm, bringing the poor little feather closer to my eyes, and cautiously opened my right eye under the tiny shadow.

A rainbow unfolded before my eyes, intertwining colorful stripes and dazzling light; the colors flowed slowly like water, reminiscent of the legendary Styx ferryboat.

"What an unforgettable scene indeed." I admired and praised.

Soon, the brightness began to visibly diminish, and even the twilight of the sky was gradually viewable.

After bidding farewell to the little white feather, I began concentrating on observing the sky. In the center of the brilliant light, a gap appeared, probably the reason for the decrease in brightness. The black gap was as big as a bowl, with edges glistening silver faintly. Due to the great distance, it was hard to discern fully.

Where is the celestial dog? Remembering the myth, I spun my eyes around, searching for the legendary creature.

A flock of white feathers floated above me, blocking my line of sight repeatedly and causing annoyance. I reached out to scatter the white feathers, but my throat inexplicably stuck, halting my actions and a chill surged within. My intuition told me something unpleasant was about to occur.

The white feathers were gradually shrinking, or perhaps distancing themselves from me.

Between the airflow and me, which is the entity in motion? This question became an unsolved mystery for a while.

"I cannot feel gravity's pull..."

"...which doesn't mean you are at rest."

Lightning struck, the remnants of consciousness fled like frightened rabbits. Starting from the center of the gray maze, they carried excessive fright and terror, rushing into the fog without purpose or direction. The frantic footstep sounds became their final mental solace.

The illusion ceased, and alongside my confused, malfunctioning brain, I looked upward, pupils unfocused and eyes vacant. The blackness continued expanding, overstepping the former pale blue sky boundary, reaching downwards with its menacing hand.

Starlight seemed to shimmer inside the black hole—that was my last thought while conscious.

A dull sound came from behind, or rather in front, rhythmically resonating. I saw a seagull agilely leap from the water, its massive white wings eclipsing the day, casting a water-blue shadow. Various lenses of different shapes and sizes continually formed, decomposed, then formed again before my eyes, freely distorting light, crumpling and tearing the seagull's image, mixing it further. Broken images, glowing edges, endless coastlines; the Mandelbrot set nodded to me in acknowledgement.

Bubbles passed over my cheeks, my vision gradually narrowed, and the brilliant sky blurred into a phantom.

The next second, the film reversed, night fell. Stars still twinkled, penetrating a thick medium, leaving an imprint on my retina.

That—was proof I still existed. Piercing cold enveloped me, and I fell into deep sleep amidst the starlight.

## Ⅱ. "Starlight"

> This is the story of a girl with flaxen hair.

The flaxen-haired girl awoke from her sleep. Around her was cold darkness, like an iron cellar buried deep underground.

Maybe because of the solid and warm touch from her back, she didn't rush to get up but rubbed her eyes with a vacant gaze full of confusion.

In disbelief, she rubbed her eyes again, waving her hands in front to demonstrate some claw gesture, then shuddered.

After a few seconds, she tortured her eyes for the third time, accompanied by a complete set of eye exercises—yet without her feet touching the ground, the last segment had to be given up.

Possibly due to cold or some other reason, the girl's hands slightly trembled.

Rapid heartbeats echoed in the darkness. Before long, soft, suppressed sobs joined in.

This sound flew gently into the distance, igniting stars.

Ranging from unreachable corners of the universe to the girl's minute abode, starlight gradually, piece by piece, lit up, jumped, and exploded around her, encircling her. Gems fell one by one, landing on the ground with ethereal crispness.

The girl stared, forgetting to shed tears. Stars flowed across the sky, their brightness fluctuating, rolling up waves.

After some unknown time passed, she regained her senses, wiped her tears, rubbed her eyes, patted her cheeks, breathed deeply, breathed deeply again, then slowly, using an elbow, propped herself up and managed to sit upright.

Surprised for a moment, there was no imagined ground glowing softly red, only starlight everywhere within view.

The girl sat poised in the void, one hand supporting the ground, the other holding her head, the astonishment evident on her face.

Shifting slowly to a squatting position, she gently exerted force on her legs, cautiously stood up, not forgetting to protect her head with a hand.

She straightened up, everything fine, ample space; the hand guarding her head happily snapped fingers then dropped softly to her side.

The girl quickly glanced around, tidied her hair, adjusted her skirt, clasped her hands together then released them.

A whistle sounded, and she stepped forward.
