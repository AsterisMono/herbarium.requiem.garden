## Broken Diary and Numb Heart

The record of daily journaling for February failed miserably.

Since returning to school on February 12, I haven't written a diary again, not a single word. My time at school was just like before, careless and lazy: sleeping in a bit longer in the morning, having a lunch that wasn't much, watching videos and browsing feeds in the afternoon, battling in Abyss with roommates in the evening, and climbing onto the creaky bunk bed late at night, playing with my phone until I can't stay awake and reluctantly going to sleep. I know this schedule is a trap, but I still fall into it. It's human inertia, and I quite enjoy this inertia.

Getting by is scarier than imagined. Once simple pleasures are within reach, certain parts of the brain are taken over by primitive cravings for fun, distracted by each app, playing each game. It gives a pass, valid for 15 seconds or 30 minutes, stamped with 'forget the future, forget oneself, clear the mind, enjoy now,' and tearing off the stub activates it, with endless refills as long as you keep the pass. The pile of stubs grows higher beneath me, and my heart turns numb, smooth, hard, resistant to change, with the resolutions and plans made at the year's start bouncing off it, producing a dull and indifferent thud. Mental narcotics are hard to quit, and relapses harder, for once you crawl out of the ditch, the illusion that you can do it anytime deceives you.

In the latter half-month, life's gyroscope started to spin, with various odd jobs coming one after another, leaving me unstable and staggering on stage. Completing the project required little effort but needed constant follow-up, no more knocking it out in an afternoon. Finding a place and contacting internships ran concurrently, and viewing apartments meant a two-hour round trip each time. Those days, I maxed out the pedometer on my smart band, returning to the dorm exhausted with only a game in mind to revive the spirit. Mental narcotics never ran short; bored in meetings? Twitter, Bilibili, Telegram, Xiaohongshu memes, QQ Space. Exhausted from moving? Telegram, QQ Space memes, Xiaohongshu, Bilibili, Twitter. Anything but learning when free, replaying the above like a hungry wolf, clinging to each information source, greedily devouring every refreshed content. Change? After completing the project. After renting the apartment. After moving out and living alone. After joining. No change.

On the last day of February, with the sun unseen, I signed the internship agreement, applied for a passport, reunited briefly with my roommate, had mala, collected two packages big and small, bought a pack of Oreos and a packet of milk, walked home along the neighborhood's main road, took a glance at the pale sky. Everything's over, I thought, excuses are gone, time to start. With three resolutions, one's down, another barely passed, and without action, the most Challenging one might die tonight. I returned home, quietly unpacking the deliveries, boiled a liter of water filling the thermos, then opened Obsidian, grabbed the keyboard.

## Living Alone, Seeking Fulcrum

Living alone has been a new and uneasy experience for me.

The personal space isn't much bigger; the shared apartment's big bed feels cold, and I need painstaking planning for the desk layout to accommodate all my digital gadgets gracefully, which remains for three days until messy chargers and electronic trash ravage it. Getting along with new roommates is another issue, though our daily paths don't cross, even without interaction, someone's room's scent chemically mingles unpleasantly with the public area, forcing me to hold my breath while using the washroom and leaving the house. Joking with friends on Discord, I say, "Let it not be enemies, that's all I wish for now." 

These are minor issues.

The saddest part is, I find no emotional value here. No family, no friends, no lovers, no career, like a wandering spirit in a deserted wilderness. People passing by have destinations, goals to achieve, loves cherished and pursued, and I walk among them daily, to meals and collecting parcels, brushing past their laughter drawing near then retreating. I've heavily relied on emotional support yet hadn't realized it in my brief life.

Someone once said on Baidu Tieba, emotions only affect my coding speed—so let it be. Starting work tomorrow, focus on work, minimal slacking during the day, recharge at night with a bath and sleep instantly, depriving myself of time for wild thoughts. Someday I may not need a fulcrum, or one day I might surrender defeated. We'll see.

## Why I Use iPhone SE1 in 2023 (And Why I Plan to Replace It)

TL;DR: Digital well-being.

Since switching the main device to iPhone SE (First Generation, 32GB), my screen usage time significantly dropped, plummeting from 6-8 hours daily to 2-3 hours. Thanks to the fading A9 chip and the humble 1GB memory, my interest in incessant scrolling on Space and Bilibili waned. When apps take half a minute to launch, the instant gratification from quickly checking a feed disappears. Though the feeds won’t vanish but shift to the computer, it's still progress. The larger screen is less tiring on the eyes, and compared to fragmented scrolling on phone, it's easier to control.

The price paid is in battery life, performance, and storage, major arteries of modern smart devices nearly severed. Despite a new battery, using it for navigation stresses its petite 1624mah cell—not real impact, rather pure anxiety. Carrying a hefty power bank risks pockets or coat suffering. Performance isn’t worth discussing; poor peak performance and memory prevent constant mobile gaming but cause stumbles occasionally during dense operations. Browsing Xiaohongshu for desired items, switching to Pinduoduo for purchase, then jumping to WeChat for payment, only to find Xiaohongshu gone on return, is indeed hard to accept. After installing necessary apps, 32G storage struggles, with WeChat intermittently prompting memory cleanup then outright freezing, teetering on a precarious 31.2GB line; if company apps are required tomorrow, I'd have no choice but to punch WeChat to free space.

As for replacing it? Of course, it got water damaged during yesterday's shower—you guessed it, right?

## Reading: "Beautiful World, Where Are You"

A piece seemingly implying much yet saying little, akin to hitting cotton with a punch.

Quoted annotations:

> Not everyone finds happiness living by your mindset, like thinking all's meaningless. Most prefer believing life holds some significance.

> Novels exist by suppressing truth—pressing it beneath the glossy surface of words.

> Might life's meaning not lie in endlessly nearing a blurry goal—like more advanced tech, evolving complex cultural forms? Aren't these just natural ebb and flow, while life's meaning is timeless—living alongside others?

> I feel everything's possible, the door behind me isn't shut, somewhere, someone will love me, admire me, bring me joy. Maybe this explains why I am open towards the world—I might be foreseeing the future, waiting for a sign, though then perhaps unknowingly.

> I'm exhausted, night deepening, half-asleep in a cab's backseat, suddenly thinking, wherever I go you're with me, he is too, as long as you're alive, this world remains beautiful for me.

> But after breaking old shackles, have we offered alternatives? Not defending enforced heterosexual monogamy, but it's a method, a way of living a life. And us? Is there a replacement? None. We hate others erring more than appreciating their virtues, hence the easiest way to live is doing nothing, saying nothing, loving no one.

> I think our views on many matters aren't wrong, but we err in how we regard ourselves. Our views are correct, but believing we're significant is our mistake.

> Young, we felt responsible for the whole world and all life it harbors. Now we only try not to disappoint loved ones, avoid excessive plastic use, while you strive to publish fascinating works every few years.

> We can't shake off the firm notion: nothing matters, life is random, our truest feelings are mere chemical reactions, cosmic moral law is absent. Sure, we can live with such views, but believing what we claim, like distinguished beautiful experiences, or rightness versus wrongness? By what standard do we measure? With whom do we converse?
